Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict Parkinson's disease based on various features derived from speech data. Using machine learning techniques, the model is trained to classify individuals as either having Parkinson's disease or not. The dataset includes features such as fundamental frequency, jitter, and shimmer, which are indicators of speech and voice abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's.

Key Features:
Dataset: The project uses the Parkinson's Disease Detection dataset, which contains voice features.
Algorithms: The model leverages machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), or Random Forest to classify the data.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's performance.
